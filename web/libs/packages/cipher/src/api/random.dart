/**
 * A synchronous secure random number generator (RNG).
 *
 * Being synchronous, this RNG cannot return direct results from sources of randomness like "/dev/random" or similar. For that,
 * use an [EntropySource] which allows to be called asynchronously. Usually an [EntropySource] should be seen like a random
 * generation device while a [SecureRandom] should be seen like a cryptographic PRNG. Thus, data from an [EntropySource] should
 * be seen as "more random" than that returned from a [SecureRandom].
